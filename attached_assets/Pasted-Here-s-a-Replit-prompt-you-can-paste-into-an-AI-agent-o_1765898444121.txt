## Replit Prompt: “Susie Sharak — Luxury Presence Lead Machine Redesign”

You are a senior product designer + conversion copywriter + front-end engineer. Redesign and implement a high-end, modern real estate website for **Susie Sharak** that feels like a **custom LuxuryPresence-style** site (clean, editorial, premium), but is **built for lead capture** and city SEO.

### Goals

1. Make the site feel premium and custom (not templated).
2. Increase leads (calls, texts, email form submissions, home valuation, showing requests).
3. Support SEO for Michigan city pages (rank for “Realtor in [City]”, “Homes for sale [City]”, etc.).
4. Fast, mobile-first, accessible, and easy to update.

### Brand + Style Direction

* **Vibe:** modern luxury, calm confidence, editorial, minimal.
* **Typography:** elegant serif for headlines + clean sans for body.
* **Layout:** generous whitespace, strong grid, big photography, subtle motion.
* **Colors:** black/white/soft neutrals + one refined accent (muted gold, deep green, or navy).
* **UI:** pill buttons, thin dividers, refined hover states, tasteful animations (no gimmicks).

### Core Conversion Strategy

Every page should push the user toward **one of these lead actions**:

* “Schedule a Call”
* “Request a Showing”
* “Get Home Value”
* “Get Listings in Your Inbox”
* “Text Susie”

Add these conversion elements:

* Sticky header with **primary CTA: “Schedule a Call”** and secondary: “Text”.
* Floating mobile CTA bar: Call / Text / Home Value.
* Short forms (name + phone + email + 1 dropdown) with strong microcopy.
* Social proof (reviews, stats, logos, neighborhoods served).
* “Instant value” lead magnets:

  * Home valuation request
  * “Downriver & Oakland Buyer Guide” email capture
  * “Off-market / Coming soon alerts” capture

### Site Map (Build These Pages)

1. **Home**
2. **Buy**
3. **Sell**
4. **Featured Areas** (hub page)
5. **Area Pages Template** (SEO city pages)
6. **About**
7. **Testimonials**
8. **Contact**
9. **Home Value** (dedicated landing page)

### Homepage Structure (Must Follow)

1. Hero (big image/video feel)

   * Headline: clear outcome + luxury vibe
   * Subhead: location focus (Downriver + Oakland County, Metro Detroit)
   * CTAs: **Schedule a Call** (primary) + **Get Home Value** (secondary)
2. Trust row: “X homes sold”, “Y years”, “5-star reviews”, “Local expert”
3. Two-card section: Buy / Sell paths (each with CTA)
4. Featured areas carousel/grid (8–12 cities)
5. Featured listings section (use placeholder data if no MLS)
6. Testimonials (scrollable, elegant)
7. “How it works” (3 steps)
8. Lead capture section (Buyer Guide / Alerts)
9. Footer with full contact, social, compliance text placeholders

### “LuxuryPresence Feel” Requirements

* Full-bleed hero, cinematic imagery blocks, editorial headings
* Subtle fade/slide animations on scroll (reduced-motion respected)
* Premium listing cards with strong typography and spacing
* Use high-quality placeholder images and swap with easy config

### Tech Requirements (Pick One Approach and Implement Fully)

**Option A (preferred): Next.js + Tailwind**

* App Router, server components where sensible
* SEO: metadata, OpenGraph, sitemap, robots
* City pages generated from a JSON dataset
* Fast performance (Lighthouse focus)

**Option B: Astro + Tailwind**

* Static-first, lightning fast
* Same SEO + city pages

### Data + Content Model

Create a `/content` folder:

* `site.json` (name, phone, email, socials, brokerage, service areas)
* `areas.json` (city pages list with unique copy blocks)
* `testimonials.json`
* `listings.json` (placeholder listings until MLS integration)

Make it so I can edit those JSON files and the whole site updates.

### SEO Requirements

* Unique title + meta description per page
* City pages:

  * H1: “Realtor in [City], MI”
  * Sections: market snapshot, neighborhoods, buyer tips, seller tips, FAQ
  * Internal linking: nearby cities + Buy/Sell/Home Value
* Add JSON-LD:

  * LocalBusiness / RealEstateAgent schema
* Create sitemap.xml automatically

### Lead Forms + Tracking

* Forms should post to a simple endpoint (or use Formspree placeholder)
* Add event tracking hooks (Google Tag placeholder)
* Thank-you states and confirmation page option

### Design System Components (Build as reusable)

* Button, Input, Select, Card, Section, Container, Testimonial, AreaCard, ListingCard, CTASection

### Deliverables

1. Fully working site in Replit
2. Clean, modern UI meeting luxury requirements
3. At least 6 city pages generated from `areas.json`
4. Clear lead capture pathways on every page
5. README: how to update content + deploy

### Constraints

* Do not use cheesy animations or generic template look
* Prioritize clarity + speed + lead conversion
* Mobile must feel as premium as desktop

Now build it end-to-end, including: routing, layout, styles, sample content, and forms.
