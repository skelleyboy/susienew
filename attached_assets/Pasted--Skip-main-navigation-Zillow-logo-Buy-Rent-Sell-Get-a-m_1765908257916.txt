Realtor

Susie Sharak Macomb Oakland Homes for Sale

Hey there! My name is Susie Sharak, and I'm a Realtor who specializes in both residential and commercial properties. I'm passionate about what I do, and my track record of success speaks for itself. In fact, I'm proud to rank in the top 5% of real estate agents in the tri-county area, and I'm honored to be a premier agent with Zillow and Realtor.com.

I'm dedicated to my clients, and my expertise and commitment to their best interests have earned me recognition in the industry. I was even featured on the cover of Top Agent Magazine and Hour Detroit magazine’s 2023 Real Estate All Stars. I'm proud to say that I was top 3 agent in my company, which had 80 agents in total in 2022

For me, real estate isn't just a job - it's a passion. I approach every transaction with honesty, patience, and a fierce commitment to fighting for my clients. Whether you're looking for the perfect home or negotiating a commercial property, you can count on me to deliver exceptional service and results.
