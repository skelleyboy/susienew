Accessibility
These checks highlight opportunities to improve the accessibility of your web app. Automatic detection can only detect a subset of issues and does not guarantee the accessibility of your web app, so manual testing is also encouraged.
Contrast
Background and foreground colors do not have a sufficient contrast ratio.
These are opportunities to improve the legibility of your content.
Additional items to manually check (10)
Show
These items address areas which an automated testing tool cannot cover. Learn more in our guide on conducting an accessibility review.
