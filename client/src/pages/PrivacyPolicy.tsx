            <li><strong>Location Data.</strong> We collect location data such as information about your device's location, which can be either precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the Services.

You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device. However, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.</li>

          <ul>
            <li>To save or protect an individual's vital interest. We may process your information when necessary to save or protect an individual’s vital interest, such as to prevent harm.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>
          <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.</p>

          <p><strong>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</strong></p>
          <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>
            <li><strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</strong></p>
          <p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.</p>
          <p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</li>
            <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
            <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
            <li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</li>
            <li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>
            <li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</li>
            <li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>
            <li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</li>
            <li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced</li>
            <li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li>
            <li>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h3>

          <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.</p>
          <p>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to gather information when you interact with our Services. Some online tracking technologies help us maintain the security of our Services, prevent crashes, fix bugs, save your preferences, and assist with basic site functions.</p>
          <p>We also permit third parties and service providers to use online tracking technologies on our Services for analytics and advertising, including to help manage and display advertisements, to tailor advertisements to your interests, or to send abandoned shopping cart reminders (depending on your communication preferences). The third parties and service providers use their technology to provide advertising about products and services tailored to your interests which may appear either on our Services or on other websites.</p>
          <p>To the extent these online tracking technologies are deemed to be a "sale"/"sharing" (which includes targeted advertising, as defined under the applicable laws) under applicable US state laws, you can opt out of these online tracking technologies by submitting a request as described below under section "DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?"</p>
          
          <p><strong>Google Analytics</strong></p>
          <p>We may share your information with Google Analytics to track and analyze the use of the Services.

          <p>If you are a resident in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), or Switzerland, then these countries may not necessarily have data protection laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as those in your country. However, we will take all necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Notice and applicable law.</p>

          <h3>7. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>

          <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

          <h3>8. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h3>
          <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</p>

By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services.</p>

          <h3>9. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h3>
          <p><strong>In Short:</strong> Depending on your state of residence in the US or in some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information.</p>
          <p>In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making.

          <p><strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.</p>

          <h3>10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>
          <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online.</p>
